You should do all your data passing between languages with piping instead of files probably. You can just pass large multiline strings and I think it would work, or maybe json would be better.
A META SDK for each language so for example you could write code in other languages all in a .js file by calling meta("c=a+b", python, ["a","b"], [c]);
Because of the fact that you are passing data back and forth in the middle of runtimes, piping probably won't work. It would only work for sequential, non-nested language blocks. But if piping is really just a buffered input, then maybe you could make your own version of this. Or maybe writing files really is just as fast.
Add error logging all throughout everything, because there is none of it rn.
Consider another section to transfer.txt files that tell whether something is a var/const/let/etc...
Need to make the sdk.meta function in .js synchronous
